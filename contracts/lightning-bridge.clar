;; Title: LightningBridge - Instant Bitcoin Payment Channels
;;
;; Summary: 
;; Revolutionary bidirectional payment channels delivering lightning-fast Bitcoin transactions 
;; with zero counterparty risk and institutional-grade security on Stacks Layer 2.
;;
;; Description: 
;; LightningBridge transforms Bitcoin payments by creating trustless, high-frequency transaction 
;; corridors between parties. Built on Stacks' Bitcoin-anchored architecture, it enables unlimited 
;; micropayments with sub-second execution while maintaining Bitcoin's security guarantees. 
;; 
;; Key innovations include:
;; - Atomic Bitcoin-compatible multisignature enforcement
;; - Cryptographic dispute resolution anchored to Bitcoin timestamps  
;; - Hybrid STX/BTC settlement architecture for maximum flexibility
;; - Clarity-optimized smart contract security with formal verification
;; - Instant cooperative settlements and robust unilateral exit mechanisms
;; - Bitcoin block-height based challenge periods for dispute resolution
;;
;; Perfect for DeFi protocols, gaming platforms, content monetization, and any application 
;; requiring high-throughput Bitcoin payments without sacrificing decentralization.
